This directory contains files used to configure CI builds in Bamboo

## Setting up a Bamboo Plan Using Scripts

These scripts are used to integrate Bamboo CI builds with GitHub pull requests. They allow Bamboo to checkout the code changes corresponding to a pull request (PR) and update the status of the build on the GitHub page. They should be used as follows:

1. Create a separate plan for GitHub PR builds.
2. Add as many stages as needed for the build and as many jobs as needed in each stage
3. Within each job, unless specified otherwise, add the following tasks in the order shown:
    * Source Code Checkout -- checkout ddf-support  
    * Script -- run buildStarted.sh to update GitHub build status to in-progress. Only needed in first job of the build  
    * Script -- run checkoutRepo.sh to checkout the correct PR  
    * Any tasks needed for the buils  
    * Inject Bamboo variables -- Load variable jobResult from the job.properties file. Will only run if previous tasks succeeded  
      `Final Tasks`
    * Script -- run jobComplete.sh. If variable jobResult was not injected, sends a failure notice to the PR status on GitHub
4. Choose one of the following methods to notify GitHub of build success:
    * If the final stage of the build has **more than one job**, add a Notification stage at the end of the build plan and give it a job with the following tasks:
        * Source Code Checkout -- checkout ddf-support  
        * Script -- run planComplete.sh to send a success notice to the PR status on GitHub  
    * If the final stage of the build has **exactly one job**, replace the final task in the job that ran jobComplete.sh with the following task:
        * Script -- run finalJobComplete.sh. This will send a success notice to the GitHub PR status if the jobResult variable was injected. Otherwise, it will send a failure notice.

**Note:** These scripts require a number of variables that are not present in a default Bamboo build. To make the plan run properly, use the Bamboo REST api `queue/{projectKey}-{buildKey}` endpoint to trigger a custom build, and have hubot pass in the following variables:
  * pull_num: The number used to identify the PR
  * pull_sha: The hash of the commit that needs to be built
  * git_repo_url: The base repository to which the PR code changes will be merged  
  
  To queue a pull request build for ddf-catalog, where bamboo is hosted at `https://bamboohost:8085/builds` and has a project with projectKey=`DDFPR` and buildKey=`CAT`, use the following request: 
  
   ```
   curl -i -X POST https://<username>:<password>@bamboohost:8085/builds/rest/api/latest/queue/DDFPR-CAT?bamboo.variable.pull_num=42&bamboo.variable.pull_sha=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709&bamboo.variable.git_repo_url=https://github.com/codice/ddf-support.git"
   ```

## Configuring Maven Builds Using settings.xml

This file is used to configure Maven with necessary credentials for downloading artifacts during the build, and to point it to the release and snapshot repositories where those artifacts are stored. It should be used as follows:

1. Create a Bamboo Maven task
2. In the Goal field, specify the settings file using the '-s' flag in addition to the goal that Maven should run

    ```
    -s ${bamboo.build.working.directory}/ddf-support/support-bamboo/settings.xml clean install
    ```
    
3. In the Environment variables field, specify the password that Maven should use for the code repositories

    ```
    NEXUS_PASSWORD=${bamboo.ddf.password}
    ```
